    Implements Coron's simplification of Coppersmith's algorithm in the bivariate case: 
    https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2007/46220372/46220372.pdf

    Per the paper, Coron's simplification relies on the following result:

    Given some p(x, y) in Z[x, y], we can fix some arbitrary integer n and construct a lattice of polynomials 
    that are multiples of p(x, y) and n, and then reduce this lattice to obtain a polynomial h(x, y) with small coefficients such that 
    if h(x_0, y_0) = 0 (mod n) for some arbitrary integer n, then h(x_0, y_0) = 0 over Z holds as well. 

    :param p: bivariate polynomial p(x, y) in Z[x, y]
    :param X: Bound for root x_0 of p
    :param Y: Bound for root y_0 of p
    :param k: Determines size of the M matrix and the corresponding lattice L_2.
    :param i_0: index such that 0 <= i_0 <= deg(p), used to generate monomials x^(i + i_0)*y^(j + j_0)
    :param j_0: index such that 0 <= j_0 <= deg(p), used to generate monomials x^(i + i_0)*y^(j + j_0)
    :param debug: Turns on debugging information
    :return: The small roots x_0, y_0 of h(x, y) such that |x_0| <= X, |y_0| <= Y, and h(x_0, y_0) = 0 over Z
